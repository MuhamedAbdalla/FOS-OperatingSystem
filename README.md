# FOS-OperatingSystem
FOS is a simulation for operating system file manager and CPU managment system. it uses algorithms that related to operating system and data structure to build a simulation for a real operating system.

○ FOS is an operating system that simulate memory manager and how OS manage CPU using a lot of Data structure like a linked list and algorithms like Round Robin, Buddy system, Clock algorithm, First fit and Best fit etc.

○ FOS has three version. Version B which has implementation of CPU management and fault handler. Version C has implementation of fault handler using clock and First and best fit technique. The final version contains a full implementation of the OS using all previous algorithms and Linked List to manage page fault.
